# Stanford Programming Methodology Assignment Solutions

These are the solutions to the 7 assignments of Stanford's [Programming Methodology]() course. The solutions of these assignments are not officially provided by Stanford, so I figured these might be helpful to many.

## How to use these assignments

I've only included the Java source files for each of the assignment. You'll find all the project files and supporting files in the starter ZIP that Stanford provides.

As of now, I have not commented the source files heavily. However, I have followed proper decomposition, and the code should read like English.

You should first attempt the assignment yourself. Come up with a solution, however ugly it might look. Then, you can refer to my sources to see what approach I have used. Yours may be better, but you'll at least know about the different approaches people follow.

## Contributions

I'm in the process of commenting these files so that I can express big picture behind these solutions. You can also help with commenting the files. Just fork this repository and send me a pull request. I'll add you to the contributor's list as well.
